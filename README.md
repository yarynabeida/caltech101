# caltech101

Welcome to Caltech101 Image Classification Project!

We've taken on the exciting challenge of identifying objects in images from the Caltech101 dataset. We tested three different approaches: a simple 3-layer CNN, a smart pre-trained ResNet model that we used as-is, and another pre-trained ResNet that we fine-tuned.

Our hard work paid off with an impressive 95% accuracy in classifying these objects! And that's not all â€“ we've also created cool visualizations to help us understand how the models work, showing the filters they use and the maps they create.
